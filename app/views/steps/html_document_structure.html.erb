<h1 class="page-header">HTML Document Structure</h1>

<h3>The HTML tag and Doctype</h3>
<blockquote>

  <p>
    The line <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is called the doctype, and it tells the browser which flavor of HTML you're using. <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> tells your browser you're using HTML5, the latest version of HTML.
  </p>

  <p>
    (You may see older doctypes out there that are longer and a lot more complicated, from when people
    used various HTML and XHTML versions, but those are annoying, and you can usually just
    use this short version for new websites.)
  </p>

  <p>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> encloses all the rest of your page, and states unequivocally, "Here is my HTML!!!"</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Pages, Like People, Have a Head and a Body</h3>
<blockquote>
  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;Invisible, Important Stuff&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;Actual Visible Content&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

  <h3>The Head</h3>

  <p>The head contains information <em>about</em> the document, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>what language or character set you're using</li>
    <li>what the page title should be</li>
    <li>what CSS and JavaScript files to include (and where they are)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Information in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section is <strong>not</strong> displayed.
  </p>

  <p>
    It can also contain metadata tags that can tell a search engine or another
    program more about the file, like who wrote it or what keywords are relevant.
  </p>

  <h3>The Body</h3>

  <p>
    The Body contains the actual content of your file, the things you'll want your users
    to be able to see, read, or interact with!
  </p>
